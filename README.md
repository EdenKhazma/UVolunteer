## 🎯 Key Data Sources

The analysis integrates multiple Toronto Public Library datasets:

1. **Branch General Information (2023)** - Core branch metadata, facilities, and program offerings
2. **Library Circulation Data** - Borrowing patterns by cardholder type
3. **Annual Visits by Branch** - Foot traffic and branch popularity
4. **Card Registrations** - New member registration trends
5. **Events Feed** - Community event programming
6. **Workstation Usage (2018-2023)** - Computer/technology resource utilization
7. **Space Rentals (2024)** - Room rental activity and facility usage

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed non-physical branches (virtual services, bookmobiles)
- Standardized data formats and handled missing values
- Created normalized metrics for comparison (see `CleaningDecisions.md` for detailed methodology)

### Key Metrics Analyzed
- Youth engagement indicators (Kids Stop programs, Teen Council presence)
- Technology infrastructure (workstation availability and usage)
- Community reach (visits, card registrations, events)
- Facility capacity (space rentals, square footage)
- Service tier and accessibility

### Deliverables
- **Interactive Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`) - Visualize branch comparisons and rankings
- **Analysis Notebook** (`notebook.ipynb`) - Reproducible analysis code and methodology
- **Final Report** (`DA08_Eden_ProjectFile.html`) - Executive findings and recommendations
- **Data Profile Report** (`SWEETVIZ_REPORT.html`) - Automated statistical summaries
